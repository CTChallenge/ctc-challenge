							 Your team is charged with creating an application that provides useful information to families and
							 addicts in an integrated form.  For example, an application might provide an integrated geolocation
							 based display of treatment resources availableâ€” or perhaps directions to the nearest Pharmacy
							 equipped to distribute Naloxone. The specific content you choose to display in your app, and the
							 manner in which you display the content to the user is up to you and your team. <br /><br />

							 Jason Adding text  just to make sure that the scroll bar is working perfectly fine. Added a bit more
							 text....... then a bit	 more.... then Jason added a lot more text just to ensure that everything was working
							 fine. And eventually he added so much text that the text field scroll bar became the size of an ant....
      <br /> <br />
							 Unfortunately he was still not satisfied and continue to add more and more text. And This is why this
							 paragraph is ridiculously long. Just so that Jason could efficiently test out the scroll bar feature and make
							 sure it doesn't affect the layout. Yup.... that's the reason. Thank you for reading.
